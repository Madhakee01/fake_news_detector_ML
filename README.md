# fake_news_detector_ML
NLP Fake News Detection with Machine Learning by training a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to detect fake news from a given news corpus. The project can be used to automatically detect fake news from a circulation news based on a trained model of thousands of news-related articles. 

Key concepts explored in this project...

1. Apply python libraries to import and visualize dataset
2. Exploratoy data analysis and plot word-cloud
3. Data cleaning: stop-words, remvoing punctuation and stop words, tokenizing
4. create text corpus to feed the deep learnign model, RNNs and LSTM
5. Build and traing the deep learning model
6.
